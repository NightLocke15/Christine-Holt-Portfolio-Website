        <h3>Project Summary:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">This project is made up of two items. First, a mobile application that aims to help people with Alzheimer's and Dementia and people with diagnoses such as ADHD and Dyslexia. Second, a medical provider dashboard that doctors can use to directly add prescriptions and tasks to their patients' profiles. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The dashboard allows the doctor to schedule appointments for their patients, set up medications and their dosages, provide all the prescription details and provide details on exercises or activities the user needs to do. They will be able to do this with a patient’s unique application ID (generated when a user creates a profile). This dashboard is still in the planning phase, as up until now, I was aiming to complete a large portion of the mobile application first. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The mobile application allows users to create to-do lists (normal, timed and checklists), store medication information, store information about the people in the user’s life, access a calendar to schedule events, see the day’s weather and make emergency calls. Many of these things will also be integrated, allowing the user to access different aspects from different pages. This will mainly have to do with the calendar, where the user will be able to see their timed lists, people’s birthdays and events. The application will also send the user notifications when these events and lists need to be tended to. </p>

        <h3>App Theme:</h3>
<p class="paragraph">This is a Dungeons and Dragons (2014) Character creator app. Users/players can create
and store all their characters in one place and access the rules of the game at any time.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><i>Character Creator:</i></p>
<p class="paragraph">The character creator will provide 2 ways to create a character: guided or unguided.
Guided creation is for new players who need help in creating their characters. The
app will provide relevant information as the player moves through the creation
process. Unguided is for players who have played before. The creation process will
not provide information unless it is requested, thus, the information will still always
be accessible.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><i>Character List:</i></p>
<p class="paragraph">The app will provide a page where the user’s characters are all stored. When
accessing one of the characters, the player will be taken to a character sheet
viewer/editor, where the users can view or edit their character sheet.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><i>Rules:</i></p>
<p class="paragraph">The rules of the game will be accessible to anyone using the app. This will be
possible in two ways: by going to the rules tab or by accessing the rules directly in
the character sheet viewer/editor. The players will either be able to manually
traverse through the rules under the rules tab or use the search function to access a
certain section of the rules. They will also be able to access it when viewing their
character sheet by using the rule search function that will bring up certain sections
of the rules or by clicking the more information button on any section of their
character sheet.</p>

        <h3>Website Summary:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">This website is designed to be simple and without fluff. The colours were chosen to perpetuate the more relaxed and fun feeling of the website. It is used as a platform to provide access to recipes without irrelevant information, as well as articles that provide further information on foods and other things, backed with facts and mixed with a few opinions. The fonts were specifically chosen for their readabulity, but also for the non-serious feel they give off.</p>

        <p class="listItem">Weight</p>
        <h3>Intent</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">For this project, we were tasked with taking the prompt and experimenting. We were tasked with expressing the intent of the project and the reflecting on our process.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I want to be able to use physics in Unity to build my prototype. However, the physics system
        in Unity I find difficult to understand. Thus, I want to attempt to build a simple system that
        simulates physics. To do this, I want to create a mechanic where an object is elevated and
        lowered by adding objects that can incrementally lift and drop the object depending on the
        added element.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why do I find the Physics system difficult to understand?</p>
        <p class="listItem">There are several elements in the physics components in the editor itself, that I do not
        understand, either because I do not know how they work, or the terminology used to
        describe them is not intuitive to me. Some terms for example, Linear drag, angular
        drag, max linear correction, max angular correction, Baumgarte scale, sleep
        tolerance., etc.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There were two ways I thought of to approach the above problem. Either I learn how to use
        the system (which is intimidating), or I ‘fake’ it in a sense, by using elements in the editor
        that I do understand, as well as code I do understand. The latter is what I am attempting to do.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How will I be using the mechanic to attempt to do this?</p>
        <p class="listItem">By using the Unity grid that is visible in Unity2D as a large graph.</p>
        <p class="listItem">By using the object’s position on the graph to determine where it is in the space I am
        building, and then simulate floating and falling using vectors in code.</p>
        <p class="listItem">By using different elements (balloons, weights, parachutes, etc.) to lift the object,
        lower the object or slow the object’s descent.</p>
        <p class="listItem sub">These elements will all have certain properties in their code to achieve this.</p>

        <h3>Intent:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">When playing a few cooperative multiplayer games, I found one mechanic that I found very
        intriguing. The mechanic consisted of two characters being tied together by a rope of sort and
        having to work together to achieve a certain goal, because they are tied together.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why did I find this mechanic to be so intriguing:</p>
        <p class="listItem">This is different to many multiplayer games I have played before, where you play
        together, but you do your own thing.</p>
        <p class="listItem">This forces players to collaborate in their solutions to puzzles.</p>
        <p class="listItem">I have made many playable characters that walk on their own, I have never made two
        playable characters that have to be attached to each other.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Because I find this mechanic to be so interesting, I would like to try and replicate it in Unity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What would I like to achieve by replicating this mechanic:</p>
        <p class="listItem">Have a Player Controller that can be used in local multiplayer games.</p>
        <p class="listItem">Find out how to tie two characters together and make this aspect work with movement
        and jumping.</p>
        <p class="listItem">Figure out how to make it look like the two players are connected to each other.</p>
        <p class="listItem">Explore different ways this mechanic can be used.</p>

        <p class="listItem">In simple terms, reactive.</p>
        <p class="listItem">I want the simulation to do something when the player interacts with it.
        What do I want to explore?</p>
        <p class="listItem">As mentioned before, there is a list of feedback elements I do not know how to
        implement, and I would like to learn how to implement them.</p>
        <p class="listItem sub">I do not want to spend several prototypes on this, so I thought the best
        course of action would be to shove it all into one prototype.</p>
        <p class="listItem">I think it might be useful to have a place where I have explored these different
        aspects and a place I can refer back to when I want to implement these aspects</p>
        again.</p>
